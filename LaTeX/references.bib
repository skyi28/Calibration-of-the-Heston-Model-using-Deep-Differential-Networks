  abstract  = {The Heston model is the most renowned stochastic volatility function in finance, but the calibration input parameters is a challenging task. This contest grows up because the instantaneous volatility is unobservable or market quotes are absent/unviable to agents, remaining the asset time-series as tangible. Moreover, these conditions are unfit to approach based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation or optimisation of the differences in Pricing models and quotes in the real market. Today, neural networks are a well-known tool with malleable and powerful features to map accurately any nonlinear continuous operator in complex systems. This work adopts the deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn the Heston parameters based on observed time series. We perform simulations of trajectories following the Heston model with a truncated Euler discretization scheme and randomised inputs parameters. The five parameters are estimated by Stacked and Unstacked DeepONets and compared with GJR-GARCH and standard neural network with the Tukeys' test. The results indicated the improvement in accuracy of the Unstacked model. However, the statistical test indicates some similarity between the Unstacked model and standard neural network.},
